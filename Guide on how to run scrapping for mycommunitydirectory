1. one is running the script on your local pc and using a VPN to bypass Cloudflare

If you are running the script on your local pc, you will need to download mycommunity.py and mycommunitydirectorycredential.json into your local pc and download a VPN to run along wih them
If you are running the script automated on GitHub Actions, than just run the script by going into Actions tab, select Run mycommunitydirecty.py, and select run workflow
